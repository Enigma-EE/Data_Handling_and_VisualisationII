    "In Python, strings are a special data type: a sequence of characters used for dealing with text, such as names or places. Also, Python has a lot of methods for manipulating strings. A string is created by inserting text in single or double quotation marks. It usually makes no difference which you choose, but there are some cases where it matters which you'll learn about. A triple quotation is used for strings that cover more than one line."
